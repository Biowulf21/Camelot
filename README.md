# Camelot - Crusader Yearbook Subscriber Manager
### NOTE: THIS PROJECT WAS CREATED FOR ME TO LEARN REACTJS

Camelot is a powerful subscriber manager built to handle the Crusader Yearbook subscriptions efficiently. This application, written using TypeScript, ReactJS, Vite, and Firebase, empowers yearbook administrators to manage subscribers, update their yearbook status, and oversee claim status with ease.

## Features

- **CRUD Subscribers:** Add, view, edit, and delete subscriber information effortlessly using a user-friendly interface.

- **Yearbook Status Updates:** Keep track of each subscriber's yearbook status, whether they've ordered, received, or canceled their yearbook.

- **Claim Status Management:** Monitor and update claim status to ensure a smooth yearbook distribution process.

## Tech Stack

- **TypeScript:** Camelot is developed using TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript, ensuring a more robust and maintainable codebase.

- **ReactJS:** The application's frontend is built with ReactJS, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.

- **Vite:** Vite is used as the build tool, optimizing the development process and ensuring rapid and efficient builds.

- **Firebase:** Firebase powers the backend, offering real-time database management, user authentication, and secure cloud storage for seamless performance.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
